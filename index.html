    <h1>Password Generator</h1>
    <p>
      What if you generate password not with 60ish alphanumeric symbols, but with 100000 different unicode symbols? There isn't even a font that can display them all. Even if you share your screen with the password on it, nobody will be able to retype that password!
    </p>
    <p>
      Secure password needs to be unpredictable and long. A 6 characters length password may be cracked instantly, 10 characters in a couple of seconds, 30 characters will give you millennia. In a dictionary attack, each common word can be cracked with similar ease as a character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generate new passwords for different websites. You may not know if a website leaked your password.
